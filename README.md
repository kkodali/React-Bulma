I plugged in Bulma into this project replacing bootstrap for RWD

Created on top of traditional create-react-app 
  - default app from react created in terminal from scratch

Clone/download into your local
cd into this project
npm start
  - This will automatically trigger the default browser with localhost:3000

Sass by default will create the required css file.
  - import css into required js file
  - create the sass file and add required mixins + styles
    - naming might be confusing
